## About Me

Hi! :wave: My name is Sirui Wu (Tina). I am a current 4th-year CS & CO student at the University of Waterloo. During my studies, I was honored to become one of the MIT Summer Geometry Initiative Fellows in summer 2024, and was fortunate to be guided by Dr. Christopher Batty on fluid simulation. As a co-op student, I also have several industrial software development internship experiences at companies including Hikvision, Ford Motor, and Soho VFX. With my strong interests in Computer Graphics and Geometry, I hope to pursue a master's or Ph.D. in these fields. Meanwhile, I am open to any related industrial internships and research opportunities.
